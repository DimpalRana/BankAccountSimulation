# Bank Account Simulation

## Description

This project is a simple **Bank Account Simulation** written in Java.
It demonstrates basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes, objects, and methods while implementing common banking operations.

## Features

* Deposit money into account
* Withdraw money with balance validation
* Check current balance
* Menu-driven CLI interface (loop continues until exit)

## How to Run

1. Copy the code from `Task5_BankAccountSimulation.java`
2. Compile:

  bash
   javac Task5_BankAccountSimulation.java
  
3. Run:

   bash
   java Task5_BankAccountSimulation

## Example Output

--- Bank Menu ---
1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Check Balance
4. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter amount to deposit: 1000
âœ… Deposited: 1000.0

Enter your choice: 3
ðŸ’° Current Balance: 1000.0


## Learning Outcomes

* Practiced Java OOP concepts
* Worked with classes, constructors, and methods
* Implemented a menu-driven CLI application
